Usage Examples
Before using "git push", make sure the correct local branch is checked out. Then, to perform the push, simply specify which remote branch you want to push to:

git checkout develop
git push origin develop
If you are publishing a local branch for the first time on a remote, the "-u" option is helpful. It makes sure that a tracking connection between the local and the newly created remote branch is established:

git push -u origin develop
After having set up such a tracking connection, you can perform future pushes without providing additional options - since the tracking connection provides default values for the push command:

git push
To delete a remote branch, simply use the "--delete" option and specify which branch (on which remote) you want to delete:

git push origin --delete feature/login
